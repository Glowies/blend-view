BlenderImageViewer is a little utility that allows blender to be used as an image or video viewer.

This can be useful when used to associate image files to an application, an example is multilayer OpenEXR images that are often not supported by other applications.


Setup

Place the three files (blendimgview blend_open_image_file.py blend_image_view.blend) into the same folder, one in your search path would be best and make blendimgview executable.

blend_image_view.blend is just a simple blend file with two screens setup to display images and movies, there is nothing special, only simple layouts.

blendimgview simply starts blender with instructions to run a python script and a list of files to work with.

blend_open_image_file.py does all the work, if you don't want to use the included blend file you can alter the filename used in blendimgview and the screen names used in this file. The list of accepted extensions can easily be extended.
